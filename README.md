#Stacked bar charts
In order to create the visualization from this post, download the sicover, sicover1, justwomen, and justwomen1 csvs (to add to repo) from the raw_data folder and then run the R script "barcharts," which uses all four of these csvs.

#R Packges Needed
You'll have to install ggplot2, RColorBrewer, ggthemes, and gridExtra in order to run the script.
